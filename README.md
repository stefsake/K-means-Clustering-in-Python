# Animal-based versus Plant- based food products: A comparison regarding environmental impact

A growing amount of evidence argues that a more plant-based diet is required to reduce human-caused climate change, as well as land and water use. In this project we examine a dataset containing 43 of the most popular foods, divide them into two categories, high environmental impact, and low environmental impact foods, and then analyse their impact per category. The results suggest that overall, the production of animal-based foods has a much higher impact on the environment than that of plant-based foods. Shifting towards a more plant-based diet mainly including fruit, nuts, and vegetables should be encouraged to promote sustainability.
